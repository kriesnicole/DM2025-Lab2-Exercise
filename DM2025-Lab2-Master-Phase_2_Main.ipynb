      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",

       "Machine learning models need training data because they are essentially **learning from examples**. Unlike traditional programming where you explicitly write rules for every scenario, machine learning models are designed to **discover patterns and relationships** within data. Training data serves as the \"textbook\" or \"teacher\" that guides this learning process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of why training data is crucial:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Pattern Recognition and Feature Extraction:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Identifying Underlying Structures:** Training data allows the model to identify recurring patterns, correlations, and underlying structures within the input features. For example, in an image recognition model, training data with many pictures of cats helps it learn what features (e.g., pointy ears, whiskers, specific eye shape) are characteristic of a cat.\n",
       "*   **Learning Relevant Features:** The model learns which features are most important for making accurate predictions. It can distinguish between noise and meaningful information.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Generalization to New, Unseen Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Goal of Learning:** The ultimate goal of a machine learning model is to perform well on data it has never encountered before. Training data provides the foundation for this generalization.\n",
       "*   **Avoiding Memorization:** If a model were to simply memorize the training data, it would be useless in real-world scenarios where new data is constantly generated. Training helps the model learn the underlying principles rather than just specific instances.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Parameter Optimization:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Adjusting Internal Settings:** Machine learning models have internal parameters (weights and biases in neural networks, coefficients in linear regression, etc.) that determine their behavior. Training data is used to iteratively adjust these parameters.\n",
       "*   **Minimizing Errors:** The training process involves feeding the data to the model, comparing its predictions to the actual outcomes (labels), and then adjusting the parameters to minimize the difference (error). This is often done using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Learning Complex Relationships:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Beyond Simple Rules:** For complex problems, it's impossible or impractical to define explicit rules. Machine learning excels at learning these intricate, non-linear relationships that might be too subtle for humans to codify.\n",
       "*   **Example:** Predicting stock prices involves a multitude of interacting factors. Training data allows a model to learn these complex dependencies.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Building a Predictive or Decision-Making Capability:**\n",

       "*   **The \"Brain\" of the Model:** The trained model essentially becomes a learned function that can take new inputs and produce outputs (predictions, classifications, recommendations, etc.).\n",
       "*   **Actionable Insights:** This learned capability allows the model to be used for various applications, from recommending products to diagnosing diseases.\n",

The child learns by observing these examples, noticing common features, and eventually being able to identify new animals they haven't seen before. Training data for a machine learning model works in a very similar way.\n",

       "**In summary, training data is the fuel that powers machine learning. Without it, the model has no basis for learning, no way to understand the problem it's supposed to solve, and no ability to make accurate predictions on new data.** The quality, quantity, and diversity of the training data directly impact the performance and reliability of the trained machine learning model."

       "### The Core Analogy: Teaching a Child\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you're teaching a small child to identify a **cat**. You wouldn't just give them a dictionary definition like \"a small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractable claws.\" That's too abstract.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "**A machine learning model learns in the exact same way.** The **training data** is the collection of examples (pictures, sounds, text) that we show the model so it can learn to build its own internal concept.\n",

       "\n",
       "Training data is a large dataset of examples used to \"teach\" a machine learning model. For most common tasks (called supervised learning), each piece of data has two parts:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Input Features:** The raw information you want the model to learn from (e.g., the pixels of an image, the words in an email, the square footage of a house).\n",
       "2.  **Correct Output (Label or Target):** The right answer that corresponds to the input (e.g., the label \"cat,\" the classification \"spam,\" the price of the house).\n",

       "The training data is essentially an **answer key** that the model uses to learn.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why Models *Need* This Data: The Four Key Reasons\n",
       "\n",
       "Machine learning models are not programmed with explicit rules like traditional software. A traditional spam filter might have a rule like: `IF email contains \"free money\" THEN mark as spam`. This is brittle and easy to evade.\n",
       "\n",
       "An ML model, however, *infers* the rules from data. Here’s why that data is essential.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 1. To Learn Patterns and Relationships\n",
       "\n",
       "The primary goal of a model is to find hidden patterns and complex relationships within data that a human might miss or be unable to define.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Example (House Price Prediction):** A model is given data for 10,000 houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location (inputs), along with their final sale price (output). By analyzing this training data, the model learns the complex relationship between these features and the price. It learns that *generally* more bedrooms increase the price, but that a good location can be even more important. It learns these \"rules\" by itself, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. To Build an Internal Representation (The \"Model\" Itself)\n",
       "\n",
       "The \"learning\" process is actually a mathematical optimization. A model starts as a generic, untrained algorithm—a blank slate. It's essentially a complex equation with millions of internal numbers, called **parameters** or **weights**.\n",
       "\n",
       "During training, the model does the following, over and over:\n",
       "1.  Takes an example from the training data (e.g., a picture of a cat).\n",
       "2.  Makes a guess (e.g., \"I'm 60% sure this is a dog\").\n",
       "3.  Compares its guess to the correct label (\"cat\").\n",
       "4.  Calculates its **error** (how wrong it was).\n",
       "5.  Slightly adjusts its internal parameters to reduce that error for the next time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The training data provides the **ground truth** necessary to calculate this error and guide the adjustments. After seeing thousands or millions of examples, the model's parameters are tuned to a state where it can accurately recognize patterns. This final set of tuned parameters *is* the trained model.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 3. To Generalize to New, Unseen Data\n",
       "\n",
       "The ultimate goal is not for the model to memorize the training data. We want it to perform well on **new data it has never seen before**.\n",
       "\n",
       "If a model is trained on a diverse and large dataset of cat images (different breeds, angles, lighting), it doesn't just memorize those specific pictures. It learns the underlying *concept* of a cat. This ability to apply learned knowledge to new situations is called **generalization**.\n",
       "\n",
       "Without sufficient and varied training data, the model can't generalize. For example, if you only train it on pictures of orange tabby cats, it will likely fail to recognize a black Siamese cat.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 4. To Avoid Human Bias and Explicit Rule-Making\n",
       "\n",
       "For many problems, the rules are too complex for a human to write down.\n",
       "*   How would you write a program to recognize a human face? There are billions of faces, all different, with varying expressions, lighting, and angles.\n",
       "*   How would you define the \"style\" of an author or the \"sentiment\" of a sentence?\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of trying to create these impossibly complex rules, we provide the model with labeled data and let it figure out the patterns on its own.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### The \"Garbage In, Garbage Out\" Principle\n",
       "\n",
       "The quality and quantity of the training data are the most important factors in a model's success.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Biased Data:** If your training data for hiring decisions only includes past successful candidates who were all from the same background, your model will learn to be biased against candidates from other backgrounds.\n",
       "*   **Incorrect Data:** If you have pictures of cats mislabeled as dogs, the model will learn incorrectly.\n",
       "*   **Insufficient Data:** If you don't have enough examples, the model won't be able to learn the patterns reliably and won't generalize well.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "In short, machine learning models need training data for the same reason a student needs textbooks and a teacher. The data provides the **examples, context, and feedback** necessary for the model to:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Learn** the underlying patterns of a problem.\n",

       "The necessity of training data for machine learning models stems from their fundamental operational paradigm: **learning from experience**. Unlike traditional, rule-based programming where explicit instructions are provided for every conceivable scenario, machine learning models are designed to **infer patterns, relationships, and decision boundaries from observed examples**. Training data serves as this crucial \"experience\" from which the model can generalize and make predictions on unseen data.\n",
       "\n",

A model aims to predict a target variable (e.g., house price, disease presence) or classify an input into a specific category (e.g., spam/not spam, image of a cat/dog). Without exposure to a representative set of inputs and their corresponding correct outputs, the model has no basis upon which to establish the mapping between the input features and the desired output.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are the key reasons why training data is indispensable:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Pattern Recognition and Feature Extraction:** Machine learning algorithms are designed to identify underlying patterns and extract relevant features from the input data. For instance, in image recognition, a model learns to identify edges, textures, and shapes that collectively define an object. This learning process is entirely data-driven. The training data provides the raw material from which these patterns are discerned.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Parameter Optimization:** Most machine learning models are parameterized systems. These parameters (often referred to as weights and biases in neural networks) are adjusted during the training process to minimize an error or loss function. The training data is used to calculate this error by comparing the model's predictions with the actual target values. The optimization algorithm then iteratively modifies the parameters to reduce this discrepancy. Without the ground truth provided by the training data, there is no error to minimize and no mechanism for parameter adjustment.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Generalization:** The ultimate goal of a machine learning model is not merely to perform well on the data it has seen, but to generalize its learned knowledge to new, unseen data. Training data, when sufficiently diverse and representative of the real-world distribution, allows the model to learn robust patterns that are not specific to individual training examples but rather capture the underlying phenomena. This ability to generalize is what makes machine learning models useful in practical applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Model Calibration and Validation:** Training data is also used to calibrate the model's confidence in its predictions. By observing how well the model performs on the training set, researchers and practitioners can gain insights into its capabilities and limitations. Furthermore, a portion of the training data is often set aside as a validation set to tune hyperparameters and monitor for overfitting, a phenomenon where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new data.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Learning Complex Relationships:** Many real-world problems involve intricate, non-linear relationships between variables that are difficult or impossible to explicitly define with rules. Machine learning models, through exposure to a large volume of training data, can learn these complex relationships implicitly. For example, predicting stock prices involves a multitude of interacting factors, and a model can learn these dependencies from historical market data.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, training data acts as the **teacher** for the machine learning model. It provides the examples, the feedback, and the context necessary for the model to develop its predictive or analytical capabilities. The quality, quantity, and representativeness of this training data are paramount to the success and reliability of any machine learning endeavor. Without it, the model remains an uninitialized algorithm, incapable of performing its intended function."

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we define this schema using Python classes. Think of each class as defining a JSON object:\n",
    "*   The **attributes** of the class (e.g., `topic_name`, `sub_title`) become the keys in the final JSON object.\n",
    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even nest these classes inside one another to create complex, hierarchical JSON structures. This allows us to precisely control the format of the output, transforming the LLM from a simple text generator into a reliable tool for automated and structured data extraction.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",

       "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",

      "  \"text\": \"**Page 1**\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nReview Iron Man 1 \\nWhen I caught up with “Iron Man,” a broken hip had delayed me and the movie had already been \\nplaying for three weeks. What I heard during that time was that a lot of people loved it, that they \\nwere surprised to love it so much, and that Robert Downey Jr.’s performance was special. Apart \\nfrom that, all I knew was that the movie was about a big iron man. I didn’t even know that a \\nhuman occupied it, and halfway thought that the Downey character’s brain had been \\ntransplanted into a robot, or a fate equally weird. \\nYes, I knew I was looking at sets and special effects–but I’m referring to the reality of the illusion, \\nif that make any sense. With many superhero movies, all you get is the surface of the illusion. \\nWith “Iron Man,” you get a glimpse into the depths. You get the feeling, for example, of a \\nfunctioning corporation. Consider the characters of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Stark’s \\nloyal aide, and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), Stark’s business partner. They don’t feel drummed \\nup for the occasion. They seem to have worked together for awhile. \\nMuch of that feeling is created by the chemistry involving Downey, Paltrow and Bridges. They \\nhave relationships that seem fully-formed and resilient enough to last through the whole movie, \\neven if plot mechanics were not about to take them to another level. Between the two men, \\nthere are echoes of the relationship between Howard Hughes and Noah Dietrich in Scorsese’s \\n“The Aviator” (2004). Obadiah Stane doesn’t come onscreen waving flags and winking at the \\ncamera to announce he is the villain; he seems adequately explained simply as the voice of \\nreason at Stark’s press conference. (Why did “Stark,” during that scene, make me think of \\n“staring mad?”). Between Stark and Pepper, there’s that classic screen tension between \\n“friends” who know they can potentially become lovers. \\nDowney’s performance is intriguing, and unexpected. He doesn’t behave like most superheroes: \\nhe lacks the psychic weight and gravitas. Tony Stark is created from the persona Downey has \\nfashioned through many movies: irreverent, quirky, self-deprecating, wise-cracking. The fact that \\nDowney is allowed to think and talk the way he does while wearing all that hardware represents \\na bold decision by the director, Jon Favreau. If he hadn’t desired that, he probably wouldn’t have \\nhired Downey. So comfortable is Downey with Tony Stark’s dialogue, so familiar does it sound \\ncoming from him, that the screenplay seems almost to have been dictated by Downey’s \\npersona. \\nThere are some things that some actors can safely say onscreen, and other things they can’t. \\nThe Robert Downey Jr. persona would find it difficult to get away with weighty, profound \\nstatements (in an “entertainment,” anyway–a more serious film like “Zodiac” is another matter). \\nSome superheroes speak in a kind of heightened, semi-formal prose, as if dictating to Bartlett’s \\nFamiliar Quotations. Not Tony Stark. He could talk that way and be Juno’s uncle. “Iron Man” \\ndoesn’t seem to know how seriously most superhero movies take themselves. If there is wit in \\nthe dialog, the superhero is often supposed to be unaware of it. If there is broad humor, it usually \\nbelongs to the villain. What happens in “Iron Man,” however, is that sometimes we wonder how \\nseriously even Stark takes it. He’s flippant in the face of disaster, casual on the brink of ruin. \\n \\nIt’s prudent, I think, that Favreau positions the rest of the characters in a more serious vein. The \\nsupporting cast wisely does not try to one-up him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts as a \\nwoman who is seriously concerned that this goofball will kill himself. Jeff Bridges makes\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nObadiah Stane one of the great superhero villains by seeming plausibly concerned about the \\nstock price. Terrence Howard, as Col. Rhodes, is at every moment a conventional straight arrow. \\nWhat a horror show it would have been if they were all tuned to Tony Stark’s sardonic wave \\nlength. We’d be back in the world of “Swingers” (1996) which was written by Favreau. \\n \\n \\nAnother of the film’s novelties is that the enemy is not a conspiracy or spy organization. It is \\ninstead the reality in our own world today: Armaments are escalating beyond the ability to \\ncontrol them. In most movies in this genre, the goal would be to create bigger and better \\nweapons. How unique that Tony Stark wants to disarm. It makes him a superhero who can think, \\nreason and draw moral conclusions, instead of one who recites platitudes. \\n \\nThe movie is largely founded on its special effects. When somebody isn’t talking, something is \\nbanging, clanging or laying rubber. The armored robotic suits utilized by Tony and Obadiah would \\nupstage lesser actors than Downey and Bridges; it’s surprising how much those two giant iron \\nmen seem to reflect the personalities of the men inside them. Everything they do is \\npreposterous, of course, but they seem to be doing it, not the suits. Some of their moments have \\nreal grandeur–as when Tony tests his suit to see how high it will fly, and it finally falls back toward \\nearth in a sequence that reminded me of a similar challenge in “The Right Stuff.” The art direction \\nis inspired by the original Marvel artists. The movie doesn’t reproduce the drawings of Jack Kirby \\nand others, but it reproduces their feeling, a vision of out-scale enormity, seamless sleekness, \\nsecret laboratories made not of nuts and bolts but of…vistas. \\nA lot of big budget f/x epics seem to abandon their stories with half an hour to go, and just throw \\neffects at the audience. This one has a plot so ingenious it continues to function no matter how \\nloud the impacts, how enormous the explosions. It’s an inspiration to provide Tony with that \\nheart-saving device; he’s vulnerable not simply because Obadiah might destroy him, but \\nbecause he might simply run out of juice. \\nThat leaves us, however, with a fundamental question at the bottom of the story: Why must the \\nultimate weapon be humanoid in appearance? Why must it have two arms and two legs, and \\nwhy does it matter if its face is scowling? In the real-world competitions between fighting \\nmachines, all the elements of design are based entirely on questions of how well they allow the \\nmachines to attack, defend, recover, stay upright, and overturn their enemies. It is irrelevant \\nwhether they have conventional eyes, or whether those eyes narrow. Nor does it matter whether \\nthey have noses, because their oxygen supply is obviously not obtained by breathing. \\nThe solution to such dilemmas is that the armored suits look the way they do for entirely \\ncinematic reasons. The bad iron man should look like a mean machine. The good iron man \\nshould utilize the racing colors of Tony Stark’s favorite sports cars. It wouldn’t be nearly as much \\nfun to see a fight scene between two refrigerators crossed with the leftovers from a boiler room. \\n \\nAt the end of the day it ‘s Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most \\nother superhero movies. You hire an actor for his strengths, and Downey would not be strong as \\na one-dimensional mighty-man. He is strong because he is smart, quick and funny, and because\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n**Page 3**\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nwe sense his public persona masks deep private wounds. By building on that, Favreau found his \\nmovie, and it’s a good one.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n\",\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "#    - Anger: steadily improves from 0.55 (F1) in zero-shot to 0.62 in 5-shot.\n",
    "#    - Fear: remains the hardest to classify correctly, with low recall across all setups, though precision is higher in few-shot.\n",
    "#    - Joy: shows strong recall in zero-shot (0.85) but more balanced F1 in few-shot scenarios.\n",
    "#    - Sadness: recall improves with more shots, but precision fluctuates.\n",
    "# 3. Overall, few-shot prompting (especially 5-shot) helps the model make more balanced predictions, but some emotions like 'fear' remain challenging.\n",

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
